"""The point of this file is to help managed talon recordings by being able to
speak a command to automatically save the last recording in a preconfigured
directory, with the assumption that the recording had some sort of error in it
that you want to document and then provide to @aegis for analysis. It allows
you to save the most recent recording, as well as replay them so that you can
actually see whether or not what you thought was an error sounded like an error
to the recording. It also allows you to remove the last saved recording in the
event that you feel that it wasn't actually an error. because the number of
recordings that can happen change fairly quickly it also provides a gui
selector that allows you to choose from a list of the most recent recordings
and have one of those specifically save to the preconfigured directory."""
